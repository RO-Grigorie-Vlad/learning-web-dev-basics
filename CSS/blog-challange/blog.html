            The British Shorthair is an easygoing feline. 
            She enjoys affection but isn’t needy and dislikes being carried. 
            She’ll follow you from room to room, though, out of curiosity. 
            British Shorthairs aren’t lap cats, but they do enjoy snuggling 
            next to their people on the couch.
